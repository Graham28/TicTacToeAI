<h1>Tic Tac Zero AI</h1>
<p>Tic Tac Zero has been trained playing against itself. It is first trained on 10,000 random games.It is then trained on games with a mixture of random moves and moves that the model predicts are good moves.</p>
<p>As the training progresses, the probability of a move being random is reduced. This results in some overtraining of the model, which means <b>it is possible to beat the model trianed on 60,000 games but not the model trained on 40,000 games.</b></p>
<p>Have a try and see if you can beat it ;)</p>
